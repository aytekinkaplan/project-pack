## 1️⃣ Introduction to Flask

**Flask** is a micro web framework written in Python. It is lightweight and easy to get started with, yet powerful enough to build large-scale applications.

---

## 2️⃣ Setting Up the Environment

To get started, install Flask:

```bash
pip install flask
```
````

Create a basic `app.py` file:

```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return "Hello, Flask!"

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

Run your application:

```bash
python app.py
```

Visit `http://127.0.0.1:5000` in your browser to see the app running.

---

## 3️⃣ Example Code Block

Here is an example of a Flask route that handles a form submission:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, render_template

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/submit', methods=['POST'])
def submit():
    data = request.form['input_data']
    return f"You submitted: {data}"
```

---

## 4️⃣ Architecture Overview

Below is a **Mermaid Diagram** showing the architecture of our Flask application:

```mermaid

    A[User] -->|Request| B[Flask App]
    B -->|Routes| C[Controller]
    C -->|Logic| D[Service Layer]
    D -->|Database Query| E[Database]
    E -->|Response| D
    D -->|Processed Data| C
    C -->|Response| B
    B -->|Response| A
```

## 5️⃣ Adding an Image

Here is an image of our final application structure:
